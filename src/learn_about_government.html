        <h1>Learn About the Government</h1>
        <h2>Three Branches of Government</h2>
        <p>Our government is composed of three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial. Their powers and duties
            are listed out via the U.S Constitution. The three branches are divided such that they can work and operate
            independently, while also having the other branches check and balance the powers.
        </p>
        <h2>Legislative</h2>
        <h3>How a Bill is Passed</h3>
        <h2>The Constitution</h2>
        <h2>Federalist Papers</h2>
        <h3>What are the Federalist Papers?</h2>
        <p>The Federalist Papers are a collection of articles and essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison,
            and John Jay, published between 1787 and 1788. The Papers advocated for the ratification of the
            Constitution. The Papers and the ideas therein contributed to the establishment of Federalism as a cohesive
            political movement, supporting a strong central government, a "vigorous Executive" (Federalist 70), an
            unassailable separation of powers, and the establishment of a merchant republic; all these ideas were
            central to The Federalist Papers, but were still among a sea of others expounded thereby.
        </p>
        <h2>Why are The Federalist Papers important?</h2>
        <p>In modern jurisprudence, The Federalist Papers are often cited as a paragon of textualism. Discussing the
            Papers in an opening statement to Congress in 2011, late Justice Antonin Scalia said, "Here's a document
            that says what the Framers thought of [the Constitution] thought they were doing. [The Papers are] such a
            profound exposition of political science that [they are] studied in political courses in Europe." George
            Washington, despite his propensity for non-partisanship, was nonetheless sympathetic to the Federalist cause
            and often sided with Hamilton and Madison in disputes with Jefferson, the founder of the Federalist's main
            opposition, the Democratic-Republicans. Many of our nation's foundational ideals—of course, largely taken
            from the views of 18th- and 17th-century philosophers like Locke and Rousseau—including checks and balances,
            a bicameral legislature, and no shortage of others today instrumental in the maintenance of our republic,
            found (and often continue to find) their justification and defense in the Papers. The Papers are not only a
            historical document but also a flourishing, vigorous defense against opponents of the Constitution. Many
            today do not realize how instrumental the founding documents of our republic were in the founding and
            maintenance thereof. Without The Federalist Papers, the Constitution would likely never have been ratified;
            if that had occurred, the United States, as we know it, may never have been formed.
        </p>
        <p>Similarly, without the Declaration of Independence, Abraham Lincoln would have had no basis on which to form
            his thesis of equality. Without the Bill of Rights, there would be no guarantee of the right to freedom of
            speech. Without the 3rd Amendment thereof, there would be no guarantee of the right to counsel. Our nation
            is the child of the Framers, whose infinite wisdom and similarly infinite lack of foresight led to the
            political system, and indeed, the philosophy that we inhabit in the present. The Federalist Papers, the
            Constitution they defended, and the Declaration of Independence that preceded both of them are some of the
            most important documents in understanding our Republic; without them, the United States not only in reality
            but also in ideal would be listless, without base political or philosophical. Therefore, The Federalist
            Papers are important.

        <h2>What are the most important ideas of The Federalist Papers?</h2>
        <p>Some of the most important ideas that are expressed in the Papers include:

        <ul> Extension of the United States beyond the borders of the Ancient Greek republics (Federalist 14)
        </ul>
        <ul>The very concept of Federalism (Federalist 39)</ul>
        <ul>Checks and balances and arguments supporting them (Federalist 51)</ul>
        <ul>The one-man executive (the President) (Federalist 70)</ul>
        <ul>nnumerable others (judicial review, bicameral legislature, separation of powers, etc.)</ul>
