    <h1>Learn About the Government</h1>
    <h2>Three Branches of Government</h2>
    <p>
      Our government is composed of three branches, legislative, executive, and
      judicial. Their powers and duties are listed out via the U.S Constitution.
      The three branches are divided such that they can work and operate
      independently, while also having the other branches check and balance the
      powers.
    </p>
    <h2>Legislative</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bicameral legislature
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two major groups or chambers: <b>House of Representatives</b> and
            the <b>Senate</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Powers include enacting legislation, declaring war, right to confirm or
        reject Presidential appointments, and investigative powers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The legislation that is enacted via this branch is in the form of bills.
        These bills are proposed, and then looked at for discussion and the
        hopes of enactment
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How a Bill is Passed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A bill is proposed legislation that Congress would like to be passed,
        and it must be approved by the president. This lengthy process follows:
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>Creation
                <ul>
                    <li>Any everyday citizen can think of the bill, but only members of Congress
                        can formally introduce it in their respective chamber (House or Senate)</li>
                    <li>Private or Public</li>
                </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Formal Introduction</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Legislator(s) formally introducing the bill will be deemed the sponsor(s)
        </li>
        <li>Proposal in the House is done by placing the bill in a hopper
        </li>
        <li>Proposal in the Senate is done on the Senate Floor
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sent to Committees</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Done after bill is read</li>
        <li>Appropriate committee will get the bill, depending on the contents regarding said bill</li>
        <li>Revisions are done and then sent  to subcommittees</li>
        <li>Possibility of a bill being tabled</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Report Ordered</li>
      <ul>
        <li>After a bill is released from the committee, the revisions must be reported
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Debate</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bill is debated and open to amendments 
        </li>
        <li>Votes to PASS or DENY</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Roll Call</li>
      <ul>
        <li>YEA for approval
        </li>
        <li>NAY for disapproval</li>
        <li>PRESENT to acknowledge their presence but choose NOT to vote
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sent to Other Chamber</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Only occurs when a majority vote is met</li>
        <li>If other chamber is Senate, they can ignore the bill</li>
        <li>They follow the same procedure as the previous chamber had done</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Presidential Approval</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Once a majority vote of approval is received from BOTH chambers (House and Senate), then the bill is sent to the president for approval
        </li>
        <li>President could veto (deny) the bill, but Congress can override this
        </li>
        <li>President’s signature passes the bill as a law
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    </ul>
    <h2>Executive</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the simplest of terms, the separation of powers between the three branches of government is as follows: the legislature passes laws, the judiciary determines the constitutionality of those laws, and the executive enforces laws.
        </li>
        <li>The President, in whom “the executive Power shall be vested”, is elected by the Electoral College. Under this system, a number of electors is chosen from each state equal to that state’s representation in the legislature; as there are two Senators per state, this can be calculated by adding two to that state’s seats in the House of Representatives. Wyoming, for instance, has one seat in the House of Representatives and is therefore apportioned three seats in the Electoral College. A President is elected if they receive a majority, today 270 electoral votes, of votes in the Electoral College. Although in some states electors can defect from their state’s voters and vote for whatever candidate they wish, voters generally vote in line with the candidate who wins the most votes in their state.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>If no candidate for President receives a majority in the Electoral College the election is decided by a vote in the House of Representatives, pursuant to the 12th Amendment. The only election decided by the House after the passage of the 12th Amendment is the 1824 election. Although Andrew Jackson won a plurality of votes in both the Electoral College and the popular vote, John Quincy Adams was elected by the House.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>For a person to be eligible for the presidency, they must:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Be a natural-born citizen of the United States
            </li>
            <li>Be at least 35 years old.
            </li>
            <li>Be a United States resident for at least fourteen years.
            </li>
            <li>U.S. Const. art. 2, § 1, cl. 5.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The President is the commander-in-chief of all branches of the United States military. U.S. Const. art. 2, § 2, cl. 1.
        </li>
        <li>The President has the power to grant “Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” U.S. Const. art. 2, § 2, cl. 1.
        </li>
        <li>The President has the power to make treaties, although these treaties must be ratified by the Senate with ⅔ of the vote. They also have the power to “nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the senate, [to] appoint Ambassadors, and other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not [otherwise] provided for [in the Constitution.]” U.S. Const. art. 2, § 2, cl. 2.
        </li>
        <li>The President has the power to make recess appointments, which are appointments made during a recess in the Senate or the House of Representatives. This means that the President can appoint any officer they have the power to without the approval of the legislature should the legislature be in recess. U.S. Const. art. 2, § 2, cl. 3.
        </li>
        <li>The President can be impeached by the Legislature and, if convicted of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors”, is removed from office. U.S. Const. art. 2, § 4.
        </li>
        <li><i>The Federalist Papers
        </i></li>
        <ul>
            <li><i>The Federalist Papers’ </i>first discussion of the Executive occurs in Federalist 67, wherein Hamilton defends the department from Anti-Federalist opponents who allege that the Executive resembles a monarch. The Anti-Federalists primary allegation is that the Executive power to make recess appointments places the Executive above the Legislature and gives the department an outsized amount of power. Hamilton rebuts that the Executive, in fact, possesses no such ability; the Presidential capacity to make recess appointments does not extend to the Legislature and only to offices “whose appointments are not in the Constitution otherwise provided for [emphasis removed][.]” Naturally, appointments to the Legislature are otherwise provided for, hence, the President possesses no power to make recess appointments to the Legislature.
            </li>
            <li>Hamilton also defends the Executive against Anti-Federalist assertions of monarchism in Federalist 69. Hamilton states that the President’s quadrennial election creates “a total dissimilitude between HIM and a king of Great Britain[.]” Additionally, the President is vulnerable to possible impeachments and other crimes which could result in their removal from office. The President’s veto ability is counterweighted by the Legislature’s ability to deny that veto and pass whatever legislation they’re voting on with a supermajority vote. Hamilton yet again emphasizes the variance between the monarch and the President therefore, given the monarch’s “absolute negative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament.”
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Judicial:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While many courts exist, the highest level is the Supreme Court of the U.S (SCOTUS)
        </li>
        <li>Currently, the Supreme Court consists of 9 total justices, all serving life terms on good behavior. A justice can be impeached if articles of impeachment are introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate tries and convicts the justice.
        </li>
        <li>Congress will determine the jurisdiction of federal courts</li>
        <li>Cases usually will start in lower district courts, but if the nature of the case deems it so that higher courts must review it, then it will go through an appeals court and finally the Supreme Court.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/21-418">Kennedy v. Bremerton School District</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Supreme Court’s main power is judicial review aka interpreting the law and when looking at cases, applying judicial review.
        </li>
        <li>Within checks and balances, judicial review can be applied to the other branches, in the event there are abuses of power and constitutionality of actions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>The Constitution</h2>
    <p>Essentially, it is the rule book of the U.S government, and how we work. Beginning this document is the phrase, “We the people”,  which sets the tone and purpose of our government. Each article states the powers of the three branches, and their checks and balances. These checks and balances (discussed in Federalist Paper 51) were to help the three branches that build our government. 
        The various powers of each branch are listed in the Constitution, as well as rights and freedoms, the fundermentals of federalism, and more.
    </p>
    <p>The necessity for a Constitution arose from the failure of the weak Articles of Confederation, which promoted the states more, but still had limited powers, to which the Constitution addresses. The Constitution is laid out as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preamble: Describes purpose and goals</li>
        <li>Articles: Describes key concepts regarding government into different parts</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Article I. Legislative Branch</li>
            <li>Article II. Executive Branch</li>
            <li>Article III. Judicial Branch</li>
            <li>Article IV. States, Citizenship, New States</li>
            <li>Article V. Amendment Process</li>
            <li>Article VI. Debts, Supremacy, Oaths, Religious Tests</li>
            <li>Article VII. Ratification</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bill of Rights: Initially, Ten rights protected by the government for the people</li>
        <li>Amendments: More rights and provisions added after the intial ratificaiton of the Constitution</li>
        <li>Procedures: Processes for elections, appointments, and more</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Federalist Papers</h2>
    <h3>What are the Federalist Papers?</h3>
    <p>
      The Federalist Papers are a collection of articles and essays written by
      Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, published between 1787
      and 1788. The Papers advocated for the ratification of the Constitution.
      The Papers and the ideas therein contributed to the establishment of
      Federalism as a cohesive political movement, supporting a strong central
      government, a "vigorous Executive" (Federalist 70), an unassailable
      separation of powers, and the establishment of a merchant republic; all
      these ideas were central to The Federalist Papers, but were still among a
      sea of others expounded thereby.
    </p>
    <h2>Why are The Federalist Papers important?</h2>
    <p>
      In modern jurisprudence, The Federalist Papers are often cited as a
      paragon of textualism. Discussing the Papers in an opening statement to
      Congress in 2011, late Justice Antonin Scalia said, "Here's a document
      that says what the Framers thought of [the Constitution] thought they were
      doing. [The Papers are] such a profound exposition of political science
      that [they are] studied in political courses in Europe." George
      Washington, despite his propensity for non-partisanship, was nonetheless
      sympathetic to the Federalist cause and often sided with Hamilton and
      Madison in disputes with Jefferson, the founder of the Federalist's main
      opposition, the Democratic-Republicans. Many of our nation's foundational
      ideals—of course, largely taken from the views of 18th- and 17th-century
      philosophers like Locke and Rousseau—including checks and balances, a
      bicameral legislature, and no shortage of others today instrumental in the
      maintenance of our republic, found (and often continue to find) their
      justification and defense in the Papers. The Papers are not only a
      historical document but also a flourishing, vigorous defense against
      opponents of the Constitution. Many today do not realize how instrumental
      the founding documents of our republic were in the founding and
      maintenance thereof. Without The Federalist Papers, the Constitution would
      likely never have been ratified; if that had occurred, the United States,
      as we know it, may never have been formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, without the Declaration of Independence, Abraham Lincoln would
      have had no basis on which to form his thesis of equality. Without the
      Bill of Rights, there would be no guarantee of the right to freedom of
      speech. Without the 3rd Amendment thereof, there would be no guarantee of
      the right to counsel. Our nation is the child of the Framers, whose
      infinite wisdom and similarly infinite lack of foresight led to the
      political system, and indeed, the philosophy that we inhabit in the
      present. The Federalist Papers, the Constitution they defended, and the
      Declaration of Independence that preceded both of them are some of the
      most important documents in understanding our Republic; without them, the
      United States not only in reality but also in ideal would be listless,
      without base political or philosophical. Therefore, The Federalist Papers
      are important.
    </p>
