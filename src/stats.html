        <h1>Why are statistics important for understanding elections?</h1>
        <p>
            Statistics are one of, if not <i>the</i>, only method(s) of
            objectively assessing election results, both before them and after
            they occur. Although statistics often make incorrect predictions,
            understanding the history of a given country and its politics can
            help you to understand much more about what may happen later in that
            country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the following statistcs are meant to illustrate the effects
            of disproportional or otherwise deficient electoral methods. The
            primary effect of disproportionate voting systems is to contribute
            to voter disengagement or exaggerate pre-existing or emerging
            disengagement trends. Conversely, electoral methods that are
            explicitly designed to be proportional and authentic to the needs
            and wants of the voting populace encourage turnout, helping to
            counteract voter disengagement and possibly even reverse previous
            trends of voter disengagement.

        <h1>Turnout in German Federal Elections</h1>
        <img src="../stat_analysis/germany_turnout_graph.png" />
        <p>
            Since its foundation, first as West Germany after World War II and
            continuing after reunification in 1989, Germany has used the
            mixed-member proportional voting system. Under this system, voters
            vote once for a constituency representative and then for a party
            list. Although each constituency only elects one
            <i>constituency</i> representative to the national legislature,
            every <i>state</i> elects several representatives to the national
            legislature off of the party list. Therefore, while regions retain
            the power thye hold in other first-past-the-post systems,
            proportionality is still allowed for and enforced by the party list.
            Turnout in German federal elections has never fallen below its
            lowest in 2009 at 70.8%. It is notable that in this election, the
            opposition party SPD lost 11.2% of their vote, while third parties
            like the FDP, the Left, and the Greens all received several
            percentage points more than the prior elections. Therefore, the drop
            in turnout can be accounted for by continued CDU/CSU dominance and a
            lack of opposition power.

        <h1>Turnout in New Zealand General Elections</h1>
        <img src="../stat_analysis/nz_turnout_graph.png" />
        <p>
            New Zealand uses an electoral system not dissimilar from that used
            by Germany. Under this system, voters still elected consituency
            representatives by first-past-the-post, but a further 55 seats were
            elected from party lists. In the first election using MMP, turnout
            spiked by 5.46% to reach a whopping 88.28%. Additionally, the number
            of Maori in Parliament nearly doubled, leading to "an all-time
            record of 17 MPs." Although New Zealand's turnout has fallen since,
            it has nonetheless never fallen below the 74.21% observed in the
            2011 general election. Is worthy of note that in the 2011 general
            election, not only did the incumbent National Party increase their
            vote share, thus possibly accounting for the drop in turnout, but
            voters also decided to keep the MMP system. Even among those who did
            vote to scrap MMP and move to another voting system, only 46.7%
            voted to return to first-past-the-post.

        <h1>Turnout in United Kingdom General Election</h1>
        <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_turnout_graph.png" />
        <p>
            The United Kingdom's electoral system, a constituency-based
            first-past-the-post system is among the most disproportionate in the
            world. As will be shown below, the number of voters that each party
            must receive to gain MPs varies widely, especially among third
            parties that experience widespread support not concentrated in
            particular areas. While recently the Liberal Democrats have
            concentrated their power base among middle-class commuter
            constituencies, especially around London, the Conservatives and
            Labour continue to exert massive power upon the political system.
            Indeed, even the Scottish National Party, which once held nearly
            every seat in Scotland, has recently lost many of their seats in the
            2024 general election, mostly to Labour with some others going to
            the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. This system has disparaged
            parties like UKIP, Reform, and the Greens with widespread but
            unconcentrated support. In the 2015 general election, for example,
            UKIP received an astonishing 12.6% of the vote but receieved
            <i>only a single seat in Parliament.</i> In other words, they
            received 12.6% of the vote but only <i>0.2%</i> of Parliamentary
            seats. Similarly, in the 2024 general election, Reform UK, the
            direct descendant of UKIP (down to being led by the same MP, Nigel
            Farage) received 12.3% of the vote but gained only 0.8% of the seats
            in Parliament. Meanwhile, Labour received 33.7% of the vote,
            representing a 1.6% change from their performance in 2019, but
            gained a staggering <i>63.2%</i> of seats in Parliament.

        <h1>Votes per MP in the 2015 United Kingdom General Election</h1>
        <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_twenty_fifteen_votes_per_mp.png" />
        <p>
            As discussed earlier, the United Kingdom's first-past-the-post
            voting system is indescribably disproportionate. This is most
            directly and objectively reflected in the number of votes each party
            must receive to gain one MP in Parliament. As mentioned, UKIP
            received 12.6% of the vote---3,881,099 votes---but received only a
            single seat in Parliament. In other words, UKIP's 3,881,099
            translated to only a single seat. By comparison, the Conservative's
            11,229,609 seats translated to 330 seats; this means roughly 34,241
            voters per seat. This means that
            <i>113 Conservative voters are worth one UKIP voter.</i> If you
            think Cromwell succeeded, your head is a little too round.

        <h1>Votes per MP in the 2024 United Kingdom General Election</h1>
        <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_twenty_twenty_four_votes_per_mp.png" />
        <p>
            A similar pattern to the 2015 general election can also be seen in
            the 2024 general election. As a result of the Conservative's
            perceived incompetenence and dissatisfaction with their performance
            after 14 continuous years of power, Labour received 63.2% of the
            seats in Parliament; however, their vote share turned out to be a
            mere 33.7% of the vote, underperforming polls by several points.
            Indeed, while the Conservativse did perform dismally, losing
            <i>nearly 20%</i> of their 2019 performance, only 1.6% of defecting
            Conservatives went to Labour. The vast majority of the Conservatives
            lost votes went to Reform, who, despite receiving 14.29% of the
            vote, representing a 12.3% swing from their 2019 performance, only
            received 5 seats.
