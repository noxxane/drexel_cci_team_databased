    <h1>Why are statistics important for understanding elections?</h1>
    <p>
      Statistics are one of, if not <i>the</i>, only method(s) of objectively
      assessing election results, both before them and after they occur.
      Although statistics often make incorrect predictions, understanding the
      history of a given country and its politics can help you to understand
      much more about what may happen later in that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the following statistcs are meant to illustrate the effects of
      disproportional or otherwise deficient electoral methods. The primary
      effect of disproportionate voting systems is to contribute to voter
      disengagement or exaggerate pre-existing or emerging disengagement trends.
      Conversely, electoral methods that are explicitly designed to be
      proportional and authentic to the needs and wants of the voting populace
      encourage turnout, helping to counteract voter disengagement and possibly
      even reverse previous trends of voter disengagement.

    <h1>Turnout in German Federal Elections</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/germany_turnout_graph.png" />
    <p>
      Since its foundation, first as West Germany after World War II and
      continuing after reunification in 1989, Germany has used the mixed-member
      proportional voting system. Under this system, voters vote once for a
      constituency representative and then for a party list. Although each
      constituency only elects one
      <i>constituency</i> representative to the national legislature, every
      <i>state</i> elects several representatives to the national legislature
      off of the party list. Therefore, while regions retain the power thye hold
      in other first-past-the-post systems, proportionality is still allowed for
      and enforced by the party list. Turnout in German federal elections has
      never fallen below its lowest in 2009 at 70.8%. It is notable that in this
      election, the opposition party SPD lost 11.2% of their vote, while third
      parties like the FDP, the Left, and the Greens all received several
      percentage points more than the prior elections. Therefore, the drop in
      turnout can be accounted for by continued CDU/CSU dominance and a lack of
      opposition power.

    <h1>Turnout in New Zealand General Elections</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/nz_turnout_graph.png" />
    <p>
      New Zealand uses an electoral system not dissimilar from that used by
      Germany. Under this system, voters still elected consituency
      representatives by first-past-the-post, but a further 55 seats were
      elected from party lists. In the first election using MMP, turnout spiked
      by 5.46% to reach a whopping 88.28%. Additionally, the number of Maori in
      Parliament nearly doubled, leading to "an all-time record of 17 MPs."
      Although New Zealand's turnout has fallen since, it has nonetheless never
      fallen below the 74.21% observed in the 2011 general election. Is worthy
      of note that in the 2011 general election, not only did the incumbent
      National Party increase their vote share, thus possibly accounting for the
      drop in turnout, but voters also decided to keep the MMP system. Even
      among those who did vote to scrap MMP and move to another voting system,
      only 46.7% voted to return to first-past-the-post.

    <h1>Turnout in United Kingdom General Elections</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_turnout_graph.png" />
    <p>
      The United Kingdom's electoral system, a constituency-based
      first-past-the-post system is among the most disproportionate in the
      world. As will be shown below, the number of voters that each party must
      receive to gain MPs varies widely, especially among third parties that
      experience widespread support not concentrated in particular areas. While
      recently the Liberal Democrats have concentrated their power base among
      middle-class commuter constituencies, especially around London, the
      Conservatives and Labour continue to exert massive power upon the
      political system. Indeed, even the Scottish National Party, which once
      held nearly every seat in Scotland, has recently lost many of their seats
      in the 2024 general election, mostly to Labour with some others going to
      the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. This system has disparaged
      parties like UKIP, Reform, and the Greens with widespread but
      unconcentrated support. In the 2015 general election, for example, UKIP
      received an astonishing 12.6% of the vote but receieved
      <i>only a single seat in Parliament.</i> In other words, they received
      12.6% of the vote but only <i>0.2%</i> of Parliamentary seats. Similarly,
      in the 2024 general election, Reform UK, the direct descendant of UKIP
      (down to being led by the same MP, Nigel Farage) received 12.3% of the
      vote but gained only 0.8% of the seats in Parliament. Meanwhile, Labour
      received 33.7% of the vote, representing a 1.6% change from their
      performance in 2019, but gained a staggering <i>63.2%</i> of seats in
      Parliament.

    <h1>Votes per MP in the 2015 United Kingdom General Election</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_twenty_fifteen_votes_per_mp.png" />
    <p>
      As discussed earlier, the United Kingdom's first-past-the-post voting
      system is indescribably disproportionate. This is most directly and
      objectively reflected in the number of votes each party must receive to
      gain one MP in Parliament. As mentioned, UKIP received 12.6% of the
      vote---3,881,099 votes---but received only a single seat in Parliament. In
      other words, UKIP's 3,881,099 translated to only a single seat. By
      comparison, the Conservative's 11,229,609 seats translated to 330 seats;
      this means roughly 34,241 voters per seat. This means that
      <i>113 Conservative voters are worth one UKIP voter.</i> If you think
      Cromwell succeeded, your head is a little too round.

    <h1>Votes per MP in the 2024 United Kingdom General Election</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/uk_twenty_twenty_four_votes_per_mp.png" />
    <p>
      A similar pattern to the 2015 general election can also be seen in the
      2024 general election. As a result of the Conservative's perceived
      incompetenence and dissatisfaction with their performance after 14
      continuous years of power, Labour received 63.2% of the seats in
      Parliament; however, their vote share turned out to be a mere 33.7% of the
      vote, underperforming polls by several points. Indeed, while the
      Conservativse did perform dismally, losing
      <i>nearly 20%</i> of their 2019 performance, only 1.6% of defecting
      Conservatives went to Labour. The vast majority of the Conservatives lost
      votes went to Reform, who, despite receiving 14.29% of the vote,
      representing a 12.3% swing from their 2019 performance, only received 5
      seats.

    <h1>United Kingdom et. al.</h1>
    <p>
      Proportionality is innately tied to voter participation. A lack of
      proportionality means a lack of voter participation. There is no better
      example of this phenomenon than the United Kingdom, where turnout has
      <i>never</i> risen above its height in 1950, at 83.9% of the vote. Turnout
      experienced a precipitous fall in the elections after Labour's 1997
      landslide under Tony Blair; it briefly recovered in 2015 and 2017, both of
      which supporters of Brexit hailed as a virtual referendum thereupon.
      However, this brief rise only gave way to a fall comparable to that of
      2001, especially in 2024.

    <h1>Turnout in United States Presidential Elections</h1>
    <img src="../stat_analysis/us_turnout_graph.png" />
    <p>
      The United States' voting system is unique in that it was essentially
      designed to be disproportionate. The Constituion is a bloody compromise
      between populous states who wished to prioritize popular
      representation---and therefore proportionality---and smaller states who
      wanted to preserve their own power. The National Archives describes the
      Electoral College "as a compromise between the election of a President by
      a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of
      qualified citizens." Today, the Electoral College has led to the election
      of a staggering 2 Presidents in the last 24 years without the majority or
      plurality of the American people supporting them. In 2000 and 2016,
      despite losing by 500,000 and 2.7 million votes respectively, George W.
      Bush and Donald Trump nonetheless advanced to the Presidency. In the
      United States, turnout essentially plateaud in 1932 with the emergence of
      the Fifth Party System and the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as
      President. Although turnout has experieced some vicissitudes since then,
      reaching its highest since 1900 in 2020. However, turnout has still never
      risen above 2020's 66.6% and the mere capability of electing a President
      who does not have the approval of a majority of the country should be a
      forceful enough possibility to necessitate immediate reform.
