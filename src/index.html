            Based in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area, Teenformation is an
            independent group focused on providing resources for youths to
            engage politically. Building upon our lived experiences as
            teenagers, we built this website as an educational resource
            pertaining to computer science, constituting an important resource
            for our generation.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
            As youths, especially teenagers, develop and grow into young adults,
            they will begin to have direct interactions with and within
            politics. Most notably of these actions includes the right to vote,
            pursuant to the 15th and 26th Amendments. Therefore, bringing
            awareness to politics amongst youth can prepare them to think and
            make make intelligent, informed decisions when they become eligible
            to vote. Already, we are involved within politics via education,
            health, technology, and more. Informing oneself about these issues
            can help shape and form their futures. Those who care for these and
            several other issues can always voice their opinions and push to
            advocate these causes, regardless of age.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
            Here at Teenformation, we provide reliable summaries of political
            information, as well as statistical analyses of voter turnout.
            Furthermore, our website includes places to seek news outlets of
            varying political spectrums, so that opinions can be formed upon
            one's own choice and research. Most importantly, we house various
            ways to engage within politics, whether it is writing to your
            legislator, or recommending forums.
