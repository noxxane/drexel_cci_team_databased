        <p class="prose">
        As youths, especially teenagers, develop and grow into young adults, they will begin to have direct interactions with and within politics. Most notably of these actions includes the right to vote, pursuant to the 15th and 26th Amendments. Therefore, bringing awareness to politics amongst youth can prepare them to think and make decisions prior to and when they are eligible to. Already, we are involved within politics via education, health, technology, and more. Informing oneself about these issues can help shape and form their futures. Those who care for these and several other issues can always voice their opinions and push to advocate these causes, regardless of age.</p>
        <p class="prose">
        Here at Teenformation, we provide reliable summaries of political information, as well as statistical analyses of voter turnout. Furthermore, our website includes places to seek news outlets of varying political spectrums, so that opinions can be formed upon one's own choice and research.
